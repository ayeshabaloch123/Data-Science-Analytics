Finally, you want the DataFrame to recognize the dates as actual dates (year/month/day) and not as strings. For each stock, you can accomplish all theses things in just one line of code by using the appropiate keywords in the `pd.read_csv()` function. Here are a few hints:\n","\n","* Use the `index_col` keyword to indicate which column you want to use as an index. For example `index_col = ['Open']`\n","\n","* Set the `parse_dates` keyword equal to `True` to convert the Dates into real dates of the form year/month/day\n","\n","* Use the `usecols` keyword to select which columns you want to load into the DataFrame.
